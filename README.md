# lwt-ruby


This is a WIP modernization of [lwt](https://github.com/TheTalkingApes/lwt) to bring it up to speed with the modern tools.

We mustn't give up on a free alternative to awesome resources for languages learners like [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/) and [LingQ](https://www.lingq.com/) and builds upon the legacy of [Anki](https://github.com/dae/anki) and [Anki-Android](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android)
