# lwt-ruby
	

This is a WIP modernization of [lwt](https://github.com/TheTalkingApes/lwt) to bring it up to speed with the modern tools.

We mustn't give up on a free alternative to awesome resources for languages learners like [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/) and [LingQ](https://www.lingq.com/) and builds upon the legacy of [Anki](https://github.com/dae/anki) and [Anki-Android](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android)


## The tech-stack that I've decided to build the project with is 

- Ruby on Rails
- ClojureScript
- MySQL

With a certain dosage of TypeScript to tackle parts where I get stuck.

## The project roadmap

- 1.0.0 => PHP to RUBY
- 2.0.0 => JQuery to TypeScript
- 3.0.0 => Introduce ReactJS via ClojureScript

Eventually the development environment would be moved to **Ubuntu-16.06 Docker image**
